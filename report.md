## Executive Summary

Simulating existing Styrene manufacturing facilities has enabled documentation of process design and continuous improvements realized through economic analysis. Currently, the base Styrene manufacturing process as purchased has been simulated to produce 11.8 million dollars of profit annually. Optimizations to the base process are outlined in this report detailing that continuous improvements could result in 18.8 million dollars of profit annually. Allowing environmental compliance, process safety, quality, and production to guide our recommendations, our plan outlines how reducing the amount of water added into the process and implementing a refrigeration cycle to recycle ethylbenzene results in economic improvements.
