# Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene to Produce Styrene

By Nathan Koch, Tim Lamoureux, Adam Schmidt, Jesse Pliska

*Prepared for PSEN 486*

## Executive Summary

This report details the simulation and optimization of a styrene manufacturing facility that produces 100,000 metric tons of styrene annually through the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. The base process generates $11.8 million in annual profit, with potential optimizations increasing this to $18.8 million annually. Key improvements include reducing process water usage and implementing a refrigeration cycle to recycle ethylbenzene.

## Key Findings

- Base process produces 11.8 million dollars of profit annually
